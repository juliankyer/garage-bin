# Garage Bin

Items need:
-id
-name
-reason 
-cleanliness (Sparkling, Dusty or Rancid)

Garage door should open and close

When items are visible, they should be expandable so we can see what we're looking at

It's not in the spec, but we should probably also be able to throw something away

Note to future self: check the view settings for logs in new devtools. ugh. Goodby, 45min.
